Hi!
My name is Holly, I am a sophomore at Lehigh University majoring in Economics and minoring in journalism and marketing.

For my first assignment, I wanted to know how the digital age has affected how the music industry. With the ever-expanding reach of the internet and our increasing dependence on all things instant, I wanted to see how this affected physical sales and how much it boosted streaming revenue. The results were staggering and unsurprising; streaming has increased from 21% to 75% in only 6 short years while physical sales have dropped 25% and digital downloads have dropped 28%.
<iframe title="Chart: U.S. Music Industry Revenue 2013-2018" aria-describedby="This chart shows the breakdown of where the music industry gets the most revenue from. Over the past 5 years, there has been a huge increase in streaming revenue and a major decrease in physical and digital downloads.

The first pie chart shows the percentage of undergraduate enrollment in the six colleges at Lehigh University in 2017.
